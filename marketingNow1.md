## Alex Rodriguez

founder and CEO of Arod Corp.

A rain delay is like Q, so the ones best prepped will win

#### How to help employees
Haven't cut people or salaries, but at the darkest moment
the company was there for the employees and team.
Being active and being all in to the company

#### What orgs, etc that have stood out in leaders
ABI - big player in china, yet still shows humanity
and cruise ships don't move the speed boat (metaphor for size of companies)

#### Sport Business Board? Thinking? Coming Back?
Some teams love debt and loss of revenues will hit hard.
Mike Ropeano, but over 90% haven't wanted a refund. Impressive.

#### Social media for you etc?
TikTok is a fun.
Don't use just one platform.
But learn the different nuances from each platform.
Right now is the time when champions are built

#### What hopes about world knowing about you?
ARock Corp does real estate (18,000 apartments)
PE/Venture side, owner of 20-25 companies
where 1/3 are not so good, 1/3 floating, 1/3 doing well
El Presidente started in 1935 and is huge deal for Alex

#### Influencer collaborations
SpencerX duetted with Elisha Keyes.
Like a music artist getting into a different genre
Charlie from TikTok,
but it is tapping into other people, audiences.
College kids know Alex through business podcasts

#### Rookie cards for Alex Rodriguez is under priced
NaN

Steady ready, stay prepared. 

## Marcel Marcondes

Lead of BudWeiser for CMO

#### How important is creativty?
This is your ticket to play.
Unless you are creative, you are not grabbing attention.

#### Optimisim, 
We all need hope and optimism during Q.
We need to talk about how to get in a better way,
instead of being consumed by fear.


#### Biggest Challenge during Q 
Redefine the agenda to pivot fast
to adjust all the routines.
Starts from within to change processes

#### How to go fast when so big
Overcommunicate, and have to be obsessed with consumer information
Don't think about What If, you become more decisive.

#### What actual decisions have done
Millions of people doing virtual happy hour.
We have a need to be happy.
We brought back the "waaassssuuupppp"
Do not forget to reach out to your friends and family
to be in a good mentally health.
Being relevant in the a good way

#### Internal Comms. for Zooms etc
Extremely surprised and started to be skeptical on productivity
but it is impressive how we continue to drive the market

#### Does Casting matter for speed?
Maybe. Some people perform better in that environment
but there is no choice to be slow.
We have to move fast

#### How did you get into Marketing Industry
Origin story:
i wanted to influence people behavior. 
But by building brands I could deal with creativity.
Since the 90's Fernanado of RBI talking about it.
Passion, etc

#### Pay attention in categories or others or not at all?
For alcohol industry, there is a process for that
because I have to know about it.
beyond category, personal interest
We can never stop learning
otherwise we will have trouble tomorrow

#### What have we not talked about yet?
Taking calc'd risk, and making decisions everyday
We will never have all the answers
but the more we understand about consumers, the more comfortable we get about decisions

#### Social Networks? (like, native, comfortable)
I use linkedin, facebook, instagram,
more of an observer 
more active on linkedIn
but others I am listening

#### TikTok? Family members, etc, 2 cents
I cannot wait to start to play with the TikTok
with the alcohol industry.


## Jill Gregory

CMO at NasCar

#### nascar is live
we are live and got wrapped up
went back to racing on may 17th
First time to not have fans
Had to do it with procedure in policy
public is starved for live sports content

#### Down and Dirty, how insane is it do be the first
Gary: not the first but the fast follower

J: There were 68 diff schedules to come back
And dealing with different govenors
It was a huge risk and it is easier to be the fast follower
but NasCar had to be bold and had to take it.
All the parameters are changing each week.


#### How did you start and get to the Apex
Get your first entry point and have to be driven
HS Jill wanted to be a sports anchor,
always loved sports.
College Jill worked at the paper.
Worked at agency and worked for clients
and getting people to drink more beer.
You can have fun but the relationships carried

#### NasCar finding wins and losses in traditional/digital
last few years, very traditional with TV etc
Now we flipped to digital and social
The amount of fans and social allowed the fans get closer to the sport
Great example is Esports with IRacing and I-Racing went on FOX

#### I-Racing was huge, what did you learn from that
We knew that was gateway to new fans, and the goal is always to grow
and people who taste NasCar get hooked
2M new fans watched I-Racing who didn't watch NasCar
The drivers and authenticity is important, more human etc

#### What admired from other marketers (unofficially)
Coke broke new creative, recognizing resturatn workers.
Calc'd risk is important
Brands are trying something new and seeing it as an important.

#### Most underpriced and overpriced from per-view
Digital offerings were important but brought new fans
the ability to curate different content for different platforms.
This situation we have to curate different content and revamp the website offerings and had to know how to follow Nascar.
Have to find how to make them care

#### social, favorite person
Chrissy teagan fan.
used as an escape and observer
interested in those who are inventing themselves
The drivers have a big chance to do that.

#### Audio, spotify
It hit radar on what we should be doing
TikTok and the drivers could be huge and advantage.

#### Anything didn't touch
Excited to get back racing and change to expose what we love about nascar, its the story lines. 


## Ann Lewnes

CMO of Adobe, communication efforts worldwide

#### pivot summit  was huge
3 days of content with new technology, inspiration speakers,

Big pivot of doing it all digital and video taped.
but 17000 were waiting to join and total of 400K people viewed content
and documented the whole process

#### Creative is overpriced, is foundation
We are the creative tool that all people need
there has never been more new creativity 
Creative cloud for students at home
30 Million students indefinitely get content

#### Online is the unlock
Giving people the screwdriver is the huge effort
Adobe has a online drawing class on the website.

G: Parents are grovelling for kids to get out of the house

#### Is Adobe delivering enough solutions?
(tracer.tech)
We went all digital 10 years ago.
Today, addressible TV is an option,
but digital ads have much more opportunity.
(OTT)

#### How to be creative and drive down costs
Now have to make 39 commercials for different audiences
but you dn't have to make 2M$ commercials

Did campaign with Billie Eilish, but the shooting was affordable (save the star)
and is the best campaign overall

#### Do people overvalue production value from business
It is taking agencies too long to get over to digital
you can put in new creative when something is not working

#### interact with Scott Belski
He is awesome, been working together.
head of product for creative
integrate with all the products.

#### Anything not touch on
Stats: Adobe analytics is huge.
Was doing study on what happening in COVID

Fitness equipment, and booze are way up. 

## Gail Tifford
G: one of my favorite people
\#1 person introduced me to Claude and dominating at UniLeaver
gone on to be major force

#### Intro to person
c brand officer at weight watchers
joined over 2 years
to transform from weight watchers to "ww"

#### Monster company, how to pivot (general and microspecific)
CEO made decision to close offices and workshops global.
30,000 workshops / week in the global.
We were focused on safey of employees and members.
Pivotted b/c we are a community.
W/i 6 days migrated to virtual workshops and trained 1000's of coaches

#### big challenge
It is hard to be from a far from all the people.

#### The app is a big role, scoop, (trend)
Weight Lifting is way down and yoga is way up
Watching behaviors and using to bring value.
used the fact of potato eating as an advertisement 

Winetext has changed my life, and become frictionless

your community is the positive place on eart

#### Part of innercircle (girls club) of operators CMO's; How manifested 
G:(Linda Boff, Kristin, Pam) and should be replicated in other industries
It is a true support system
Gail: C suite level of marketing/media has become sisterhood
and was safehaven for females in the big male dominated events
You know they have your back.
Even when it is not convinient, sticking up for eachother's back.
this is not a man-hating thing

Gary gets invited sometimes and talks about hair colorings and was 
best meeting ever had.

Women in other industries need support and only strong as weakest link.
Look at your peers and they will be the ones.

hates the word 'Networking', it is more like connecting on a human level.
Having Gary as the one man in the group of girls club; 
with women speaking their truth is an amazing piece of content.

#### Anything didn't touch on?
No, G is doing great work

## Chris Bruzzo

CMO of EA

@cbruzzo

#### Intro
Responsible for commericial and marketing
with the full cycle of getting, driving revenue, and whole life cycle of game

#### Gaming 
Record breaking and time of year is quiet for releases,
record breaking enagement, not only veterans coming back but
also so many people coming for the first time
300M people already registered but now 10'sM people register for the first time
Sims community is off the charts

#### Challenges
volume, 
devs used to take time off, but now everyone is working full year
including devs and marketing.
big downside is people are tired but also recognize that this is the moment when champions are built.

#### how did you get in, how hardcore vid games were you?
have been gaming and used play simcity on the early consoles.
Ran a BBS on a dial up modem. (total nerd)
got time to work for Amazon and entertainment
then got into Starbucks and music,
but the whole time I got into gaming
Now at EA

#### Big Titles, how hard
EA lets out every year and takes 1000's of people to take to market
and its software that is built with bugs and whatnot and the budget of 
a normal cinema masterpiece

#### Shifts in games
