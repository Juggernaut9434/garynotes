### Big for Facebook move into Commerce
Look FB, Insta had shopping in early years.
Now similar to Shopify and removing friction to start
selling stuff online.
"Shop" is the main name for Facebook / Instagram
And will integrate with the backend what ever you are using.
Directly to consumer.

Go to amazon, sell your product, but the problem is you don't know your audience, but FB gives data to your backend (Shopify) to see who the audience is.

Worried about E-Com and not having community. 
FB will build community.

Shopify will go total digital even though they built a office in Toronto. (big rip)

Low hanging fruit is blog post recipes and making them shopable

Super lowhanging fruit and learning the economics to ecommerce.

You need to get creative on how to talk about sports without any live sports.
Some people bought all the horses before the car was invented.

Reality is that sports are happening and you have to kill your expenses. ( kill the burn ). Just stay alive business wise.

### how Banks leverage Ecom like Apple making ecosys
Banks have to be real careful, who ever is in front of the customer wins.
Most banks don't give a lot of love. 
You realize you need the banks but they don't help you as much.

people focus too much on how to build it, just build and put it out there then rebrand when it comes.

Advanced access, and education.
