## Tariq Hassan
CMO of Petco.
currently in transforming Petco and is well known in the business

### Most on the your mind during Pandemic? Challenges, etc
Transforming from a retail to a health and care business.
Common themes from family to pet families.
We had to first convince people we are essential for pets.
The next is "how do we open" and keeping everyone safe.
Last, stepping up and getting what the parents needed.
We had to re-invent a few things but the partners Petco has
is incredible.

### biggest thing you leared as operator
We had transform to consistent with shipping with 
2-3 days and being everyday a black friday.

We are private equity held. 
And the leadership came in to pivot from retail
to health and fitness.

### Have you tried new things personally in Q?
Going viral on TikTok completely razes his daughter lol
 and definitely got new ideas for marketing.

G: the decision makers are becoming the practioners of their
platforms (fields)

T: We had to find new ways of content like safety and groomers.
It is not a time to sell, its a time to serve

### Online 
We have had our consumers buy for the first time buying online.
And the older generation are also getting on the internet.
Petco found their digital confidence during all this. 

We have to find and solve the health issues with your pet, 
not just the sell.

## Shelley Zalis
#marketingforthenow @ShelleyZalis 
a mentor for a lot of people
founder of CEO of The Female Quotient

### Origin story
Advancing female equality through collaboration.

when you add more women, the bigger the quality.
We are inspiring the future leaders and the now generation

We just launched the dinner series to unite women over 100 countries.

### What was the inspiration
We can't get too deep in our head and just be brave and couragous.
She wants to bring emotional strengths to the board room.

G: Most Top CEO's were taught as children to not be emotional and 
never taught emotional intelligence.
And we need more integration between men panels and women panels.

Really taking on the boys club. 
And when you are afraid, you go with your friends 
and one woman, your invisible, when together, we are seen.

Gender equality is not a man problem, woman problem, its a society problem.
Its a leadership problem

### WWE belt behind you
a WWE belt that says "chief trouble maker" custom made by a friend.

G: We need dominos to fall for systematic problems. 
We will always have systematic problems with race,
like Europe and anti-semitism.
And there should be more girl's clubs in every league, sports, etc.
but we shouldn't demonize the boys club either. 

## Jesse Stallak
CMO for converse, from a 15 year at Nike
Brining brand back into basketball

a rare breed of being a practioner.

### How did you stay so current and ear to the ground?
I was just curious and digital was a major game changer.
Through curiousity and practice, I was able to bring it into the marketplace.

Working at Nike, the innovation and curiousity through that medium
and wanting to understand how the technology works.
and how it connects to human behavior.

### yes/No, has converse been able to innovate during COIVD?
Not innovate, but create a new way of creating content like TikTok
and the creators and athletes in the community by workin with them to create.
There is a lot of demand for perfomance media.

### Biggest challenge to becoming a CMO?
(professional development) 
Not executing on the strategy, but at the table building the strategy.

It starts with deep into research and listening to the mission
and listening to the market and learning from that.

### Crazy Responsibility
because there is history in converse and has a lot of historical impact.

there is first youth brand and have been adopted by who shifted culture like Big O.
And how to fuel the new generation.

### How to work with the classic board member, leader
being transparent and pulling them into the process. 
Have similar agendas and have more impact and finding those who align with your values.

This is not about going back to normal, but creating a new normal.
And Q is an accelerator. you either get on board or get left behind

## Todd Kaplan
t_kap
VP of Marketing at Pepisco.
Pivot in the Quarantine.

### Food service has been Descimated, Challenge, Opportunity?
Soda is a big time territory

We started 2020 really strong with a new tag line and SuperBowl.
Then Q happens has a huge change in rules in business.

We had to focus on our people and making sure everyone in the pipeline
is still functional.
The main opporunity, we connect with culture and how to connect authentically.

Parterning with Global citizen to make being at home more enjoyable.

Being in high speed and velocity plus flexibility is huge.

### Working from home observations
Always been flexible at Pepsico,
and we have been on Zoom 
but now being used with more humanity.

Culturally, we are way more connected than before.

### Media consumption
We knew all the ideas like grocery pickup, 
but no one went all in and committed before Q.
Now we find leaning in to those more.

People are understanding the role of the home more
trying to get innovative than before.

### How to get into mindset of SuperBowl or big things?
culture in, brand out. but now it is cultural context
and bring your brand on top of that.

## Kory Marchisotto
CMO of Elf cosmetics.
called the "rocketship" in her business

### Origin and Career
Hesitant about corporate job, and it was love at first sight.
Stayed in beauty since there.
Once we get past selling product and to self-confidence

### What is Elf?
make beauty accessible to all people.

Eyes, lip, face (elf) started on the impossible 16 years ago on the digital roots.

With the CEO being entrepeneurship and being high speed.
Not afraid to be the first.

### Consumer Comment Reading
G: consumer comment reading is the unlock for sucess

ELF is for everyone, by everyone, of the people. 
That is a big message and you have to follow through.
With other companies being powerpoint, say it but don't do it.

We start with the consumer and led through data insights leading to threads and patterns.

When the CMO is so down to earth in the consumer, working with other teams, it can get frustrating.

### What platform is best for elf
Tiktok is the best platform, propelling the brand forward into a new sphere.
Talking with kids is a great way of learning the social media.
Instagram is the place where you feel bad about yourself,
tiktok is about the place you be yourself.

G: For now, not forever. Media is always changing.

Go where the audience is, and find platform.
And you can't just cut and paste your content on Instagram and put on TikTok
because it is dead in the water. 

G: TikTok is a huge place for music, being good looking won't get you famous.

Lean into what works. Double down and what's next.
The beauty brand worked with the music industry and blew up overnight.
The infinite mindset.

G: Companies can do anything they want when they execute properly.
A lot of brands are only posting 10 times a month instead of the right way of 10 times a day.

## Linda Boff
Big Big player in GE, CMO

### Biggest challenge
G: Ge is like hall of fame level

GE has been working around a corner.
Largely behind aerospace and totally set on ice during Q.

We are turning to offense, and how to.
its time to tell our story and find ways to tell the story.

### Virtual Communication
Memorial Sloan has ramped up teledoctor up to 7000/month.

do we need to go to air shows, etc?
But those 4-5 extra flights that we don't need to do, getting cut.

### Advertising in Q
Brand has to do what is right for them.
And aviation was a hard hit.
So, start small and agile.

We let our employees take over our social media platforms, 
and was huge sucess.

We are taking baby steps. small but smart.

Very few brands are being smart on LinkedIn, and GE has become a powerhouse for GE.

### New Consumer Behavior, personally
- Support local businesses
- Goldbelly
- alernatives to Amazon
- Living in the present a lot more

G: We are going to see people more often because of Zoom
and that will lead to more physical interactions.
